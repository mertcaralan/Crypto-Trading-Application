### 🔍 **User Profiles**
The **User Profile Management** feature allows users to create and manage multiple profiles for a personalized trading experience. Here’s how it works:
- **Create, view, and delete profiles**: Users can easily create new profiles, each with their own trading history and portfolio. Profiles can also be deleted if no longer needed.
- **Switch between profiles**: When logged in, users can select a profile to track their personal trading history and performance.
- **Trading history per profile**: Each profile has its unique trading records, showing past buy/sell transactions, wallet balance, and portfolio value. This ensures that users can simulate multiple trading strategies across different profiles.
- **Local storage**: Profiles are stored locally on the browser using `localStorage`, allowing users to persist data across sessions.

### ⚖️ **Trading Simulation**
The **Crypto Trading Simulation** feature mimics real cryptocurrency trading based on historical market data, allowing users to perform simulated trades without financial risk. Key aspects of this feature include:
- **Buy and Sell Trades**: Users can execute buy and sell transactions for different cryptocurrencies using virtual funds. The trade is executed using historical data from the `db.js` file, which contains a set of simulated market prices.
- **Cryptocurrencies Available**: The application supports multiple popular cryptocurrencies, such as:
  - **Bitcoin (BTC)**
  - **Ethereum (ETH)**
  - **Cardano (ADA)**
  - Other cryptocurrencies can be added in the future to expand the platform.
- **Realistic Trading Experience**: The simulated trades are based on past market data, which gives users an opportunity to explore how the market reacts to different conditions without any real financial risk.
- **Interactive Candlestick Charts**: Integrated **candlestick charts** provide users with visual insights into market trends and price fluctuations. These charts show historical price movement in intervals, offering a more professional view of market behavior.

### 💳 **Wallet Management**
The **Wallet Management** feature allows users to manage their virtual cash and cryptocurrency holdings. After each trade, the wallet updates in real-time to reflect the new balance. Key aspects include:
- **Virtual Wallet**: Users receive a starting balance of virtual cash (USD or other fiat currencies) and can buy and sell cryptocurrency assets within the platform.
- **Real-Time Balance Updates**: The wallet automatically updates after every transaction, showing the latest balance of cash and crypto holdings. Users can check how their portfolio is performing.
- **Detailed Transaction Breakdown**: Each trade performed is recorded with details such as the cryptocurrency traded, the amount bought or sold, the price at the time of trade, and the resulting wallet balance. A summary of all transactions is displayed for users to keep track of their trading activity.
- **Transaction History**: Users can view their transaction history in the wallet, which includes previous buys, sells, and current holdings.

### 🎨 **Interactive User Interface**
The **User Interface (UI)** is designed to be visually appealing, engaging, and user-friendly. Here are the features:
- **Smooth Transitions and Animations**: All actions, including profile switching, trading actions, and page loads, feature smooth animations to enhance the user experience. This ensures that users have an enjoyable and intuitive interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop computers to mobile devices. This ensures the platform is usable and attractive on all devices.
- **Customizable Settings**: Users can personalize their experience, such as adjusting the theme, setting default cryptocurrency, or choosing a preferred currency for the wallet.
